				<h1>SOLUTION</h1>
				<p>Greentrotter believes that traveling can be sustainable through smart choices 
				and an appreciation of the entire journey from start to finish.</p>

				<p>As part of the goal towards reaching a more sustainable planet, many airlines have created offline programs 
					to counterbalance the greenhouse gas emissions they are responsible for, and The World Wildlife Foundation, 
					in collaboration with other Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), have created The Gold Standard 
					as a guideline for carbon offset projects. However, the WWF also urge consumers and businesses to see offsetting 
					as the last resource when other alternatives have been exhausted. They describe a three-step approach: 
					“avoid, reduce, then offset” [Source 6]</p>

				<p>Greentrotter takes this approach seriously, and they believe that sustainable tourism should include 
					a meaningful experience and tourist satisfaction [Source 7]. Additionally, they recognize that the opportunity 
					for people to plan and book a sustainable, roundtrip journey is insufficient [Source 8].
					That is why Greentrotters have created the Greentrotter travel app.
					</p>

				<p>An appropriate comparison of the different travel method’s effect on the environment is challenging 
					because passenger transport has different impacts within several different categories. 
					However, they can be measured by the <a href="http://ecopassenger.hafas.de/hafas-res/download/Ecopassenger_Methodology_Data.pdf">
					relevance of the impact, proportional significance of passenger transport compared to overall impacts, 
					data availability and methodological suitability for a quantitative comparison of individual journeys </a>[Source 9]. 
					By taking advantage of algorithms designed to estimate these measurements, the Greentrotter app 
					is able to combine all the available forms of passenger transportation and calculate the most sustainable transportation method 
					from and to, any given destination within the appropriate time frame. By using the Greentrotter app 
					in combination with travel destinations suggested on the Globetrotter website, 
					you are given the best tools in order to live a more sustainable globetrotter life. </p>
