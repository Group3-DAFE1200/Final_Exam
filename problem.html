				<h1>PROBLEM</h1>
			<img src="">
				<p>Saving our planet is arguably the toughest mission of our time. 
					The cumulative level of greenhouse emissions grows rapidly due to the constant increase in population, 
					living standards and international economies. This is causing the global temperature to rise significantly 
					and has extensive impacts on the future of the globe. Taking action to limit the effect of climate change 
					is crucial in order to achieve a sustainable planet for future generations [Source 1]</p>
					
				<p>The Greentrotters team are painfully aware of the effect of climate change, however they are also a curious bunch 
					that loves exploring the world through international travel. Statistics show that a significant amount of air pollution 
					is caused by fossil fuel emissions from means of transport such as air travel and road traffic [Source 2). 
					<a href="https://earth.org/how-airlines-are-adopting-carbon-offsetting/">In 2018 carbon emissions from commercial aviation made up 2.4% of fossil fuel-related global emissions </a> 
					and The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) believes that this will triple by 2050 [Source 3].</p>
					
				<p>Tourism is important because it generates jobs, contributes to economic growth and encourages 
					a greater understanding of different cultures [Source 4]. The Greentrotter team also believes 
					that traveling inspires an increased appreciation for the planet we live on. 
					However, they recognize that for the Greentrotter team and the rest of the world to continue their journey as 
					globetrotters, they must think of a more sustainable way to travel.</p>

				<p>The UN stresses that an important factor in the fight against climate change are the lifestyle changes 
					that each individual consumer makes [Source 5]. Greentrotter aims to be an important contributor to reaching 
					the UN Sustainable Development Goals by providing a solution that allows people to make the most sustainable travel choices, 
					and encourages travelers to look at the journey to the destination as part of the overall experience.</p>
